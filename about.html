        <p>It took me a while to try out their pizza. A colleague who loves their pizza dragged me along on one of her eats and from then on have become hooked on their pizza. They are quite generous with their toppings. Their service is also quite good. Can't compare to other pizza joints.</p>

        <p>Always order here for a fast pizza and always never disappointed. The service is top notch with attention to what customers want. You could even get free cheese bread with a delayed order!!!</p>
